**not_null** is a **0-overhead**, modern utility for ensuring non-nullability
in a coherent way.

Unlike `gsl::not_null`, this type can work with move-only pointers like
`std::unique_ptr`, and does not require runtime checks unless explicitly
specified.

## Teaser

```cpp
auto register_widget(cpp::not_null<std::unique_ptr<Widget>> p) -> void
{
  legacy_service.adopt_widget(std::move(p).as_nullable());
}

...

// use 'cpp::check_not_null' to check and validate that 'p' is not null
register_widget(cpp::check_not_null(std::move(p)));
```
