<img align="right" src="http://opensource.org/trademarks/opensource/OSI-Approved-License-100x137.png">

**Result** is licensed under the [MIT License](../LICENSE),
which is an open-source initiative approved license.

Under this license, you may use **Result** for any purpose you wish
_WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY_, and modify it as you see fit -- subject to the one
condition:

> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in
> all copies or substantial portions of the software

## Simplified

In non legal terms, this means that whenever an application built with
**not_null** is distributed -- either as source code, or as a binary package,
the [license text](../LICENSE) must also accompany the distribution in some
form.
This may be in the form of a printed documentation, a digital list of
credits distributed with the application, or even as acknowledgement
from within the application itself (e.g. in credits, 'about', etc).

Similarly, if the **not_null** project is used as the basis to a new
library or distribution, attribution must be made for any substantially copied
portions (algorithms, designs, etc.).

## Endorsement

At no point is **not_null** or any of its contributors to be misrepresented as
endorsing a project that uses this utility without prior written
acknowledgement from the maintainers.
